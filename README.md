## Overview

In "web portals" provided by healthcare organizations, patients are given access to more and more data, like physician and test result notes or care instructions. This is great, but the bulk of these notes are written for other healthcare professionals, and it can be difficult for patients to digest and synthesize this information to properly understand it.

There is a market gap here that our team aim to close by partnering with healthcare organizations to provide a "friendly mode"! We will augment patient portals with an AI- driven plugin, and your product will process this complex health information and simplify it for the patient right inside the browser. We decide to integrate our product into an existing website, and how the patient will interact with it.
